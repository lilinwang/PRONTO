PRONTO provides a practical way to manage protocols and the process of updating protocols through email notifications, making a
practice always ready for high quality imaging.

A free open source web-based protocol management system (Demo: http://pronto.trove.nyc) using an open source
LAMP software stack using the PHP CodeIgniter Framework (Source Code: http://src.pronto.trove.nyc) to manage the process of
protocol updates. This software allows for easy distribution (web-based), updating (CSV upload), and notification (email notification
for new and modified protocols). We created standard spreadsheets with defined columns for both CT and MR parameters. Protocol
changes involve (1) editing the spreadsheet and (2) then uploading the CSV. The webapp will automatically detect any new
protocols or changes to existing protocols, which will (3) trigger an email notification.We currently have uploaded our CT protocols
(total of 162 protocols), and are working to upload our MR protocols.
